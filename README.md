This project has two scenes; the main scene contains two sprites, one of a smiski and a flower, and the next scene, labeled as forest, includes two objects, a PNG of a forest and a sun. I wonder if the hierarchy of the files within the file system matters when it comes to scenes or if the different scenes should just contain their nodes within the scene view.
